# Stock-Analysis
For Investors to properly manage their portfolios, they need to visualize datasets, find useful patterns and gain valuable insights such as stock daily returns and risks. In this project we will use the power of python to perform stock data visualization and stock return calculation.
The Dataset contains stock prices of certain companies listed in S&P 500. S&P 500 is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on U.S. stock exchange.
